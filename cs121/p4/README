# Project 4: Reader of Books

* Author: Austen Hale
* Class: CS121 Section 3
* Semester: Fall 2018

## Overview

This program is a GUI that allows the user to import either 3 or 19 
pre-downloaded books. From there, the user can select a book
to read it and scroll through it.

## Compiling and Using

To compile the code, simply run the program. To use the code, after compiling,
start by importing either booklist.csv or booklist-full.csv in the import books
text area. After importing the books, select a book that you would like to read
and scroll through it using the page up and page down buttons.

## Sources Used

The only source I used outside of class resources was to find out how to 
measure from the top of the scrollbar (its extent). I found this out by 
//credit JeroenWamerdam of StackOverflow
			int extent = contentScrollPane.getVerticalScrollBar()
					.getModel().getExtent();
using the above code, which is credited to JeroenWamerdam of StackOverflow.
