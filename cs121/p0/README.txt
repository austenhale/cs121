# Project 0: Traffic Animation

*Author: Austen Hale

*Semester: Fall 2018

##Overview

My program runs and animates a catapault moving across the screen. 
On top of the catapault is a snowman that moves along with the catapault, with a bystander snowman in the background.

## Compiling and Using

To use this program, simply run the program and watch the animation. There is no further user input outside of running the program.
