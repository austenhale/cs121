## Overview

This program allows a user to play a game of TicTacToe against a computer, on a GUI.
My program also allows the user to see how many games were played, and whom won each one.

## Compiling and Using

To compile the code, simply run the program, or type 'javac TicTacToeGUI.java' followed by 
'java TiCTacToeGUI' into the console. As for playing the game, it is just like a game of
Tic-Tac-Toe, where you (X) choose a spot, and the computer chooses another spot. The game
continue until either player matches 3 in a row, diagonal, or column, or all spaces are taken.
