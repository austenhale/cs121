#Project 3: Library Of Books

*Author: Austen Hale
*Class: CS121 Section 3
*Semester: Fall 2018

## Overview

This program adds one of three pre-downloaded books, and adds them to a library. The user, after
adding a book, can then read the book, add another book, delete a book, or print the library contents.

## Compling and Using

To use this program, begin by running it. The program will give the user a list of options to 
choose from ((R)ead [a book], (A)dd [a book], (P)rint [the library], or (D)elete [a book]. To
actually make use of the program, the user will first have to add a book and follow through 
the instructions listed on the screen (and ensure that the filepath for the book is 
exactly the same as the one they input). After adding a book, they can print the library to 
see the index of the book. Using that index, they can either read the book by entering that index
in the read section, or delete it by entering the same index in the delete section. Hitting Q
will exit the program for the user.

## Sources Used

None outside of class material and the book.
